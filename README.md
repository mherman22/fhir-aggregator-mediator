# FHIR Aggregator Mediator

An [OpenHIM](https://openhim.org/) mediator that aggregates FHIR R4 search results from multiple FHIR servers into a single endpoint. Designed for use with [google/fhir-data-pipes](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes) to sync data from multiple sources to a shared FHIR store through a single pipeline.

## Problem

[google/fhir-data-pipes](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes) supports a single `fhirServerUrl` as its data source. When you have **multiple FHIR servers** you'd traditionally need to run a separate pipeline instance per server — one for each EMR, facility, or data source. At scale (10, 20, or more sources) this quickly becomes an operational burden: 20 sources means 20 separate pipeline processes to deploy, monitor, tune, and upgrade.

This mediator solves that by presenting all your FHIR servers as **a single FHIR endpoint** so one pipeline can sync data from all of them.

It is designed for two complementary scenarios:

- **Centralized aggregation** — a national health information exchange, shared health record (SHR), or analytics platform that pulls from many facility-level EMRs without running a separate pipeline per facility.
- **Demo / test environments** — multiple EMR instances running on a single machine sharing one pipeline.

## Compatible Sources

The mediator works with **any FHIR R4 server** that returns standard search Bundles:

- **OpenMRS** with the [FHIR2 module](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/FHIR+Module) (including iSantePlus)
- **HAPI FHIR** servers
- **Any FHIR R4 compliant server** that supports `_getpages` pagination

Sources can be mixed — you can aggregate an OpenMRS instance, a HAPI FHIR server, and any other FHIR R4 server in the same configuration.

## How It Works

```

1. Pipeline sends a FHIR search to the aggregator (e.g., `GET /fhir/Patient?_count=100`)
2. Aggregator fans out the request to all configured sources in parallel
3. Responses are merged into a single Bundle
4. Pipeline uses offset-based pagination (`_getpages` + `_getpagesoffset`) to fetch all pages
5. Pipeline writes the aggregated data to the sink FHIR store

## Quick Start

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t fhir-aggregator-mediator .
docker run -p 3000:3000 fhir-aggregator-mediator
```

### Docker Swarm

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml fhir-aggregator
```

### Verify

```bash
# Health check — shows per-source status
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# FHIR metadata
curl http://localhost:3000/fhir/metadata

# Search patients across all sources
curl http://localhost:3000/fhir/Patient?_count=20
```

## Setup & Configuration Guide

This section walks through how to configure a full deployment with the FHIR Aggregator Mediator sitting between your FHIR servers and a data pipeline (or any FHIR client).

All runtime configuration lives in `config/config.json`. Edit this file to match your environment — no code changes are needed.

### Step 1 — Define Your FHIR Sources

Add every FHIR server you want to aggregate to the `sources` array. Each entry requires:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `id` | A unique short identifier (used in logs, health endpoint, and environment variable overrides) |
| `name` | A human-readable label |
| `baseUrl` | The FHIR R4 base URL (must end at the FHIR root, e.g. `/fhir` or `/openmrs/ws/fhir2/R4`) |
| `username` | HTTP Basic Auth username (leave empty `""` if the source requires no authentication) |
| `password` | HTTP Basic Auth password (leave empty `""` if no authentication) |

```json
{
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "facility-a",
      "name": "Facility A (OpenMRS)",
      "baseUrl": "http://openmrs-a:8080/openmrs/ws/fhir2/R4",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "Admin123"
    },
    {
      "id": "facility-b",
      "name": "Facility B (HAPI FHIR)",
      "baseUrl": "http://hapi-fhir-b:8080/fhir",
      "username": "",
      "password": ""
    },
    {
      "id": "facility-c",
      "name": "Facility C (OpenMRS)",
      "baseUrl": "http://openmrs-c:8080/openmrs/ws/fhir2/R4",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "Admin123"
    }
  ]
}
```

On startup the mediator validates every source by hitting its `/metadata` endpoint. If any source is unreachable or returns an error (including 401/403 auth failures), it will retry for up to 15 minutes (useful when upstream EMRs are still booting) and then exit with a clear error if validation still fails.

#### Environment Variable Overrides for Credentials

To avoid storing passwords in the config file, you can override credentials per source via environment variables:

```
SOURCE_{id}_USERNAME=admin
SOURCE_{id}_PASSWORD=s3cret
```

For example, given a source with `"id": "facility_a"`:

```bash
export SOURCE_facility_a_USERNAME=admin
export SOURCE_facility_a_PASSWORD=s3cret
```

> **Note:** The source `id` becomes part of the environment variable name. Use underscores rather than hyphens in source IDs so that the resulting variable names are portable across all shells (e.g. `facility_a` instead of `facility-a`).

This is especially useful for Docker deployments where you pass secrets through the environment or orchestrator secrets management:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e SOURCE_facility_a_PASSWORD=s3cret \
  -e SOURCE_facility_b_PASSWORD=other-secret \
  fhir-aggregator-mediator
```

### Step 2 — Configure the Application Port

```json
{
  "app": {
    "port": 3000
  }
}
```

The mediator listens on port `3000` by default. Change this if the port conflicts with other services in your stack.

### Step 3 — Configure OpenHIM Registration (Optional)

The mediator registers itself with [OpenHIM](https://openhim.org/) on startup and creates an HTTP channel at `/aggregated-fhir`. This is **optional** — the mediator works standalone at `http://localhost:3000/fhir` without OpenHIM.

```json
{
  "mediator": {
    "api": {
      "username": "root@openhim.org",
      "password": "instant101",
      "apiURL": "https://openhim-core:8080",
      "trustSelfSigned": true,
      "urn": "urn:mediator:fhir-aggregator"
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `username` | OpenHIM admin username |
| `password` | OpenHIM admin password |
| `apiURL` | OpenHIM Core API URL |
| `trustSelfSigned` | Accept self-signed TLS certificates from OpenHIM (set `true` for development) |
| `urn` | Unique mediator URN registered with OpenHIM |

The channel configuration is defined in `config/mediator.json`. It maps incoming requests at `/aggregated-fhir` to the mediator's `/fhir` endpoint and restricts access to the `shr-pipeline` client:

```json
{
  "urn": "urn:mediator:fhir-aggregator",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "name": "FHIR Aggregator",
  "defaultChannelConfig": [
    {
      "methods": ["GET"],
      "urlPattern": "^/aggregated-fhir.*$",
      "routes": [
        {
          "host": "fhir-aggregator",
          "port": 3000,
          "pathTransform": "s/\\/aggregated-fhir/\\/fhir/g",
          "primary": true
        }
      ],
      "allow": ["shr-pipeline"]
    }
  ]
}
```

If OpenHIM is unreachable at startup the mediator logs a warning and continues running — it does not block.

### Step 4 — Tune Performance Settings

```json
{
  "performance": {
    "timeoutMs": 30000,
    "maxSocketsPerSource": 5,
    "rejectUnauthorized": true
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `timeoutMs` | `30000` | Per-source HTTP request timeout in milliseconds. Increase for slow sources. |
| `maxSocketsPerSource` | `5` | Maximum concurrent TCP connections per upstream source. Connection pooling with keep-alive is enabled automatically. |
| `rejectUnauthorized` | `true` | Set to `false` to accept self-signed TLS certificates from upstream FHIR servers (development only). |

There is also a request-level timeout at the Express layer (`requestTimeoutMs`, default `120000` ms) that guards against slow upstreams hanging the HTTP response indefinitely. If a request exceeds this limit the mediator returns HTTP 504 with a FHIR OperationOutcome. To override the default, add `requestTimeoutMs` to the `performance` section:

```json
{
  "performance": {
    "timeoutMs": 30000,
    "requestTimeoutMs": 120000,
    "maxSocketsPerSource": 5,
    "rejectUnauthorized": true
  }
}
```

### Step 5 — Configure Pagination Cache

Pagination state (per-source `_getpages` tokens) is stored in an in-memory LRU cache:

```json
{
  "pagination": {
    "cacheMaxSize": 1000,
    "cacheTtlMs": 3600000
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `cacheMaxSize` | `1000` | Maximum concurrent pagination sessions before the oldest is evicted |
| `cacheTtlMs` | `3600000` | Token expiry in milliseconds (default: 1 hour). Set this longer than your longest pipeline run. |

### Step 6 — Enable Clustering (Optional)

By default, the mediator runs as a single Node.js process. For production workloads with CPU-intensive dedup or large fan-out operations, you can enable clustering to fork one worker per CPU core. Each worker runs its own Express server and LRU pagination cache, sharing the same port via the Node.js `cluster` module.

#### Configuration

Add a `cluster` section to `config/config.json`:

```json
{
  "cluster": {
    "enabled": true,
    "workers": 4
  }
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Set to `true` to fork multiple worker processes |
| `workers` | `os.cpus().length` | Number of worker processes. Set to `0` or omit to use all available CPU cores. |

#### Environment Variable Overrides

You can also enable clustering via environment variables (these take precedence over `config.json`):

```bash
# Enable clustering
export CLUSTER_ENABLED=true

# Optionally set worker count (defaults to CPU count)
export CLUSTER_WORKERS=4
```

Docker example:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CLUSTER_ENABLED=true \
  -e CLUSTER_WORKERS=4 \
  fhir-aggregator-mediator
```

#### How It Works

- The **primary process** forks worker processes and monitors them. If a worker exits unexpectedly, it is automatically restarted.
- Each **worker process** runs a full Express server with its own LRU pagination cache, FHIR client, and source monitor.
- Workers share the same port via the OS kernel (round-robin on Linux, OS-level distribution on macOS/Windows).
- The in-process pagination cache is per-worker by design. Since each worker can independently re-fetch pages from upstream sources, stateless pagination remains correct even when consecutive requests land on different workers.

#### Alternatives: Running Multiple Replicas

Instead of (or in addition to) Node.js clustering, you can run multiple container replicas behind a load balancer:

- **Docker Swarm**: Set `replicas: N` in `docker-compose.yml`
- **Kubernetes**: Set `replicas: N` in your Deployment spec
- **OpenHIM**: Already supports load balancing across multiple mediator instances

This approach is preferred when you need independent memory limits per replica or are already using container orchestration.

### Step 7 — Point Your Pipeline at the Aggregator

Configure the [fhir-data-pipes](https://github.com/google/fhir-data-pipes) pipeline to use the aggregator as its FHIR source in `application.yaml`:

```yaml
fhirdata:
  fhirServerUrl: "http://fhir-aggregator:3000/fhir"
  fhirServerUserName: ""
  fhirServerPassword: ""
```

The aggregator handles authentication to each upstream source internally — the pipeline itself does not need credentials.

  },

    "threshold": 1024
  }
}
```

### Deploying with Docker Swarm

The included `docker-compose.yml` is designed for Docker Swarm. It injects both config files as Docker configs and attaches the mediator to the `openhim` and `isanteplus` overlay networks:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t fhir-aggregator-mediator .

# Deploy to the swarm
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml fhir-aggregator
```

To customize configuration for your environment, edit `config/config.json` and `config/mediator.json` before deploying. Docker Swarm will mount them into the container at `/app/config/`.

Resource limits are set in the compose file (512 MB memory, 0.5 CPU) and can be adjusted to fit your deployment.

## API

### `GET /fhir/metadata`

Returns a synthetic CapabilityStatement listing all 161 supported FHIR R4 resource types.

### `GET /fhir/:resourceType?_count=N&_since=...`

Searches all configured sources in parallel, merges results, and returns a FHIR Bundle. All query parameters are passed through to each source. No deduplication is performed — duplicate resources from different sources are passed through as-is.

- `_count` — page size (default: 20, max: 500)
- `_since` — passed through for incremental sync

If results span multiple pages, the Bundle includes a `next` link with a `_getpages` token.

### `GET /fhir?_getpages=TOKEN&_getpagesoffset=N&_count=M`

Offset-based pagination. The token maps to per-source `_getpages` tokens stored in the LRU cache. The offset and count are forwarded to each source.

### `GET /health`

Returns per-source health status with circuit breaker state:

```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "sources": [
    { "id": "facility-a", "status": "UP", "name": "Facility A", "lastError": null, "lastChecked": "...", "circuitBreaker": { "state": "CLOSED", "failures": 0 } },
    { "id": "facility-b", "status": "DOWN", "name": "Facility B", "lastError": "ECONNREFUSED", "lastChecked": "...", "circuitBreaker": { "state": "OPEN", "failures": 5 } }
  ]
}
```

Returns HTTP 200 when all sources are UP, HTTP 503 when any source is DOWN or AUTH_FAILED.

### `GET /ready`

Returns HTTP 200 when the mediator has completed startup source validation and is ready to serve requests. Returns HTTP 503 during the startup validation period. Use this as the Kubernetes readiness probe.

### `GET /metrics`

Returns Prometheus-compatible metrics in exposition format. Includes:
- `http_request_duration_seconds` — histogram of inbound request latency
- `http_requests_total` — counter of inbound requests by method/route/status
- `active_requests` — gauge of in-flight requests
- `upstream_request_duration_seconds` — histogram of upstream FHIR server latency
- `upstream_errors_total` — counter of upstream errors by source and error type
- `pagination_cache_size` — gauge of current cache entries
- `pagination_cache_hits_total` / `pagination_cache_misses_total` — counters
- Default Node.js metrics (GC, event loop, memory)

## Source Health Monitoring

### Startup Validation

On startup, the mediator validates credentials for every configured source by hitting `/metadata`. If any source is unavailable, the mediator retries for up to 15 minutes (90 attempts × 10 seconds) to allow slow-starting upstream services (e.g. iSantePlus) to boot. If validation still fails after all retries, the mediator **exits immediately** with a clear error message instead of silently serving incomplete data.

### Per-Request Tracking

When a source fails during a request, the response includes headers indicating which sources were unavailable:

```
X-Aggregator-Sources-Failed: facility-b,facility-c
X-Aggregator-Sources-Failed-Count: 2
```

This allows monitoring systems to detect degraded operation.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Source down during request | Warning logged, results from remaining sources returned, `X-Aggregator-Sources-Failed` header set |
| Source auth fails on startup | Mediator retries for up to 15 min, then exits with `FATAL: Source validation failed` |
| Source auth fails during request | Source marked as `AUTH_FAILED` in health, remaining sources still serve data |
| Circuit breaker OPEN | Source skipped entirely (no request sent, no timeout waited) until reset timeout expires |
| Transient upstream error (502/503/504) | Automatically retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff + jitter |
| Pagination token expired | HTTP 410 Gone returned, pipeline retries on next schedule |
| All sources down | Empty Bundle returned |
| Request timeout (>120 s) | HTTP 504 with FHIR OperationOutcome |
| Rate limit exceeded | HTTP 429 with FHIR OperationOutcome and `Retry-After` header |
| Invalid query parameter | HTTP 400 with FHIR OperationOutcome |

## Architecture Scenarios

### Scenario A — Centralized aggregation (recommended for 10+ sources)

A national HIE or analytics platform runs **one pipeline** and **one aggregator** that fans out to all facility EMRs. This replaces N separate pipeline deployments with a single, observable, operationally-managed service.

### Scenario B — Per-site pipeline (when sites are self-contained)

Each facility is a standalone site with intermittent internet that manages its own data sync. The aggregator adds no value here — each site just needs its own pipeline pointing at its own EMR.

### Scenario C — Demo / test (multiple instances on one machine)

Multiple EMR instances run on a single machine sharing one pipeline. The aggregator presents all instances as one FHIR endpoint. Useful for training, integration testing, and demos.

### When to Use the Aggregator

| Scenario | Aggregator? |
|----------|-------------|
| Centralized analytics: N facility EMRs → one pipeline → one SHR/data lake | **Yes** |
| National HIE: pull from 10–20+ facility FHIR servers centrally | **Yes** |
| Demo/test: multiple EMR instances on one machine, one pipeline | **Yes** |
| Development: testing pipeline against multiple data sources | **Yes** |
| Training: simulating multi-facility setup on a laptop | **Yes** |
| Per-site deployment: each facility runs its own self-contained pipeline | No |

## Production Readiness for Large-Scale Deployments (10–20+ Sources)

The mediator ships with production-grade features. When deploying against many sources, work through this checklist.

### ✅ Core features — already implemented

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Parallel fan-out to all sources | `aggregator.js` — `Promise.all()` across N sources |
| Per-source circuit breaker | `circuit-breaker.js` — CLOSED → OPEN → HALF-OPEN; skips failed sources immediately |
| Retry with exponential backoff + jitter | `fhir-client.js` — `axios-retry`, retries on 502/503/504 and network errors |
| Upstream concurrency limiting (semaphore) | `semaphore.js` — caps in-flight upstream requests across all sources |
| Connection pooling + keep-alive | `fhir-client.js` — per-source `http.Agent`/`https.Agent` |
| Stateless pagination (replica-safe) | `pagination.js` — base64url-encoded tokens, no server-side state |
| Prometheus metrics | `metrics.js` + `/metrics` — request/upstream latency histograms, error counters |
| Structured JSON logging + correlation IDs | `logger.js` (pino) — every request gets a UUID |
| Health + readiness probes | `/health` (liveness), `/ready` (readiness) |
| Node.js clustering (multi-core) | `cluster.js` — forks one worker per CPU core |
| Kubernetes manifests | `k8s/deployment.yaml` — Deployment, Service, HPA (2–10 replicas), PDB |
| Security headers | `helmet` middleware |
| Response compression | `compression` middleware |
| Full configuration via env vars | `config-validator.js` — all settings overridable |
| Config validation at startup | Fails fast with clear errors on bad config |
| Non-root Docker container | Node 22-alpine + `USER node` |

### 🔧 Configuration tuning for 20 sources

**1. Set the upstream concurrency semaphore**

Without this, each inbound request fans out to all 20 sources simultaneously. Under burst load, that multiplies to hundreds of concurrent upstream calls:

```json
"performance": {
  "maxConcurrentUpstreamRequests": 60
}
```

Start at `3 × source-count` and adjust based on upstream capacity.

**2. Tune sockets per source**

```json
"performance": {
  "maxSocketsPerSource": 10
}
```

With 20 sources at 10 sockets each you can sustain 200 concurrent upstream TCP connections. Scale down if sources are resource-constrained.

**3. Configure circuit breaker thresholds**

```json
"circuitBreaker": {
  "failureThreshold": 5,
  "resetTimeoutMs": 30000
}
```

With 20 sources, more circuits can open simultaneously during a degraded event. Set `failureThreshold` low enough to open quickly but high enough to avoid flapping.

**4. Right-size the container**

The default `512Mi` / `0.5 CPU` is fine for a handful of sources but may be tight when merging large bundles from 20 sources in parallel. For 20 sources with `_count=200`:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "1500m"
    memory: "1536Mi"
```

Monitor `container_memory_working_set_bytes` and adjust.

**5. Set a realistic per-source timeout**

With 20 sources the total response time is bounded by the *slowest* source (they run in parallel). Set `timeoutMs` to match your worst-case source:

```json
"performance": {
  "timeoutMs": 45000
}
```

Pair this with circuit breaker — once a source trips its circuit, it is skipped with no timeout cost.

**6. Check your pagination token URL length**

Stateless tokens encode one `_getpages` token per active source. For 20 sources the base64url token is typically 1–2 KB — well within standard HTTP URL limits (8 KB). Verify your reverse proxy / load balancer limit if you use very long upstream tokens.

### 🔒 Security checklist

- [ ] **Inbound auth** — the mediator does not authenticate inbound requests natively. Front it with [OpenHIM](https://openhim.org/) (client certificates, channel auth) or a reverse proxy with authentication.
- [ ] **TLS termination** — the mediator listens on plain HTTP. Terminate TLS at your reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik, Envoy) or at OpenHIM Core.
- [ ] **Secrets management** — use Kubernetes Secrets + `envFrom` for all 20 sets of credentials (via `SOURCE_{id}_PASSWORD` / `SOURCE_{id}_USERNAME`). Never commit credentials to `config.json`.
- [ ] **`rejectUnauthorized`** — leave `true` (default) unless upstream servers use self-signed certificates.
- [ ] **Rate limiting** — configure `rateLimiting.maxRequests` to match your expected pipeline request rate. The pipeline is the only intended client; setting a tight limit prevents accidental flooding.

### 📊 Observability checklist

- [ ] **Prometheus scrape** — add `/metrics` to your Prometheus scrape config.
- [ ] **Alert on circuit breakers** — alert when `upstream_errors_total` for any source rises; indicates a tripped circuit.
- [ ] **Alert on upstream latency** — alert when `upstream_request_duration_seconds{quantile="0.99"}` exceeds your SLO.
- [ ] **Alert on failed sources** — monitor the `X-Aggregator-Sources-Failed-Count` header in your pipeline logs, or scrape the `/health` JSON.
- [ ] **Log aggregation** — ship pino JSON logs to your log platform (ELK, Loki, CloudWatch). Filter on `correlationId` to trace a single pipeline request end-to-end.

### ⚠️ Known limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| No clinical deduplication | The mediator removes exact-ID duplicates (to prevent HAPI transaction bundle rejection) but does **not** perform patient/encounter matching. If the same real patient exists in two sources with different IDs, both records appear in the output. Route through [OpenCR](https://github.com/intrahealth/client-registry) for patient matching. |
| Startup validation is all-or-nothing | If any configured source is permanently unreachable at startup, the mediator will not start (retries for 15 min then exits). For optional/degraded sources, remove them from config or pre-validate that they are reachable before deploying. |
| No write aggregation | The aggregator is read-only (`GET` / search). It does not proxy write operations (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) to upstream sources. |
| No SMART/OAuth upstream auth | Sources must use HTTP Basic Auth or no auth. Sources that require OAuth/SMART tokens are not supported. |

## Releasing

This project uses an automated release process through GitHub Actions that integrates with our SNAPSHOT-based versioning.

### Quick Release Process

1. **Go to [Release Action](https://github.com/mherman22/fhir-aggregator-mediator/actions/workflows/release-dispatch.yml)**
2. **Click "Run workflow"**
3. **Select version type:** patch/minor/major
4. **Click "Run workflow"** to start the release

That's it! The automation handles everything else.

### What Happens During a Release

The workflow automatically:
1. **Validation** - Ensures you're releasing from a SNAPSHOT version
2. **Testing** - Runs the full test suite
3. **Changelog Generation** - Creates changelog from [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
4. **Version Management**:
   - Removes `-SNAPSHOT` suffix for release (e.g., `1.1.0-SNAPSHOT` → `1.1.0`)
   - Creates git tag for the release
   - Bumps to next development version with `-SNAPSHOT` suffix
5. **GitHub Release** - Creates release with changelog and Docker image info
6. **Docker Image** - Automatically builds and pushes to GHCR

### Version Types

- **Patch** (`1.1.0-SNAPSHOT` → `v1.1.0` → `1.1.1-SNAPSHOT`): Bug fixes, small improvements
- **Minor** (`1.1.0-SNAPSHOT` → `v1.1.0` → `1.2.0-SNAPSHOT`): New features, backwards-compatible changes  
- **Major** (`1.1.0-SNAPSHOT` → `v1.1.0` → `2.0.0-SNAPSHOT`): Breaking changes

### Process Overview

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[1.1.0-SNAPSHOT] --> B[GitHub Actions Release]
    B --> C[1.1.0 Release]
    C --> D[1.1.1-SNAPSHOT]
    C --> E[Docker Image]
    C --> F[GitHub Release]
```

### Changelog Generation

The workflow automatically parses conventional commits to generate structured changelogs:

- `feat:` → ✨ New Features
- `fix:` → 🐛 Bug Fixes  
- `docs:` → 📚 Documentation
- `refactor:` → ♻️ Refactoring
- `perf:` → ⚡ Performance
- `test:` → 🧪 Testing
- `chore:` → 🔧 Maintenance

### Alternative: GitHub CLI

If you prefer command line and have [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed:

```bash
# Patch release
gh workflow run release-dispatch.yml -f version_type=patch

# Minor release  
gh workflow run release-dispatch.yml -f version_type=minor

# Major release
gh workflow run release-dispatch.yml -f version_type=major

# Pre-release
gh workflow run release-dispatch.yml -f version_type=patch -f prerelease=true
```

### Pre-releases

You can mark releases as pre-releases by checking the "Mark as pre-release" option when triggering the workflow.

### Troubleshooting

**"Current version is not a SNAPSHOT"** - This means the current version in package.json doesn't end with `-SNAPSHOT`. Manually update package.json to the next SNAPSHOT version (e.g., `1.1.1-SNAPSHOT`).

**Release workflow failed** - Check the [Actions tab](https://github.com/mherman22/fhir-aggregator-mediator/actions) for detailed logs. Common issues: test failures, git conflicts, or permission issues.

**Need to hotfix a release** - Create a hotfix branch from the release tag, make the fix with conventional commit format, then run the release workflow.

> **Note**: Previously this project used a `release.sh` script. The GitHub Actions approach is more robust and provides better changelog generation.

### Pinning versions in downstream projects

Use a specific version tag in your docker-compose rather than `:latest`:

```yaml
image: ghcr.io/mherman22/fhir-aggregator-mediator:1.0.0
```
